## Guidelines for assessing new candidates for committership

When a contributor is nominated to become a committer, the following guidelines should be used by existing committers to evaluate the nominee's suitability.

### Ability to work cooperatively with peers

How do we evaluate? By the interactions they have through mail. By how they respond to criticism. By how they participate in decision-making process.

### Ability to be a mentor

How do we evaluate? By the interactions they have through mail. By how clear they are and how willing they are to point at appropriate background materials (or even create them).

### Community

How do we evaluate? By the interactions they have through mail. Do they help to answer questions raised on the mailing list; do they show a helpful attitude and respect for other's ideas.

### Committment

How do we evaluate? By time, by sticking through tough issues, by helping on not-so-fun tasks as well.

#### Personal skill/ability

How do we evaluate? A solid general understanding of the project. Quality of discussion in mail. Patches (where applicable) easy to apply with only a cursory review.
